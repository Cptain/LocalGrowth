# Contributing to LocalGrowth Project


## General 

 If you want to help with the code, first I would suggent you to setup the webapp as described in the README.
 Get a bit familiar using git, and after modifying the code try to do a pull request.


 A detailed list of things required will be at our [trello page][1].

## As a developer 
  
  A big help would be helping with the testing framework.


## As a designer
 
 You can find the related files and modify them to your liking

 *  HTML "app/views"
 *  CSS & JavaScript "app/assets"
